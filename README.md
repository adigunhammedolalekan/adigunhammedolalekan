### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hammed, a Software Engineer currently living and working in the United Kingdom. I specialize in designing and building scalable backend systems. I love working with Golang, JVM based languages, Typescript, Linux containers, and cloud-native technologies.

I currently work at [Vega](https://vega.investments) as a backend engineer, I am a core member of the team and I am helping to develop the operating system for private wealth management. Weâ€™re using cutting edge technologies like Java22, Typescript, Docker and Kubernetes etc to power a highly efficient and robust platforms for our clients.

Prior to that, I was working at [Goldman Sachs International in London](https://www.goldmansachs.com/), where I was helping to build high quality customer relationship management tools for Goldman's Investment Bankers throughout the world. Using Java, Python, AWS and cloud-native techs, weâ€™re able to deliver modern, scalable and robust systems for our clients.

I love hacking on projects on the side. In the past, I've worked on projects like

- [csail.sh](https://www.github.com/adigunhammedolalekan/csail.sh) - a simple way to deploy and scale docker containers in a kubernetes cluster.
- [registry-auth](https://github.com/adigunhammedolalekan/registry-auth) - a library to aid in implementing authentication and authorization system for private docker registries.
- And, [more](https://github.com/adigunhammedolalekan?tab=repositories).

I also write at [Hammed Adigun's Blog](https://lekan.wtf/)

When I am not at work or hacking something on my computer, I love playing football and exploring new restaurants :stuck_out_tongue:
